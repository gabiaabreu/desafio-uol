# UOLHOST

### ðŸ“ƒ Disclaimer

This app (currently in progress) is my attempt at the UOLHOST front-end challenge, which you can learn more about [here](https://github.com/uolhost/test-frontEnd). The main goal was to create a website following a pre-made design and interface.

It's a client list that displays some info and includes features like **editing** an existing user or **adding** a new one. I also added some extra features, like **deleting** an user. Forms have **masks** and **validation** for phone and CPF inputs. I implemented snackbar warnings, not found and empty state components.

The API endpoint made available by UOL was no longer accessible when I started doing it, so I mocked my own using **JSON Server**.

This is a work in progress, so I'll be adding new features in the future and improve what I already made. I'll also add unit tests later on.
