# UOLHOST

### ðŸ“ƒ Disclaimer

This app (currently in progress) is my attempt at the UOLHOST front-end challenge, which you can learn more about [here](https://github.com/uolhost/test-frontEnd).

The main goal is to create a website following a pre-made design and interface.
It's a client list that displays some info and includes features like editing an existing user or adding a new one.

I also added some extra features, like deleting an user.

The API endpoint made available by UOL was no longer accessible when I started doing it, so I mocked my own using JSON Server.

This is a work in progress, so I'll be adding new features in the future and improve what I already made. I'll also add unit tests later on.
